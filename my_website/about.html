<p> So, just sit sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time 
 for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
 And here they are! Bachelorette number 
 one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
 a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
 and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
 include cooking and cleaning for her 
  two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
  Bachelorette  
 number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
  the land of fancy. Although she lives 
 with seven other men, she's not easy. 
 Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
 find out what a live wire she is. Come 
  on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
  picture of Snow White) And last, but 
 certainly not last, bachelorette number 
  three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
 But don't let that cool you off. She's 
 a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
 and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
 be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
 number two or bachelorette number three?.</p>
